    "For example, you should already be able to explain:\n",
    "* the benefits of measuring data quality\n",
    "* what each of the 6 DAMA Dimensions are and what they mean\n",
    "* what a completeness score of 0.5 means\n",
    "* how multiple scores are combined to give an overall data quality index\n",

    "* You should have some basic python knowledge\n",

    "* To be able to measure data quality on dataframes\n",

    "#### Introduction\n",
    "The aim of timeliness as a measure is to check a date falls within a certain range (i.e. later than 'start' and earlier than 'end').\n",
    "\n",
    "We have two flavours of this function:\n",
    "* timeliness_static (fixed start and end dates)\n",
    "* timeliness_relative (relative start and end dates)\n",

    "Requiring this flexibilty of date comparisons was one of the main reasons for writing our own package. It's not so simple as finding one date is earlier than another, we often require a date to fall within a certain window.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### A note on 'time'\n",
    "There are plenty of ways to get time calculations wrong, given time zones and British Summer Time.\n",
    "Within the function we normalise everything to UTC. If the dates you are measuring are not written in ISO 8601 standard with timezone information or a UTC offset, then we assume it's UTC and raise a warning. \n",
    "\n",
    "If none of your times have timezone information then this won't matter (as everything will just change to UTC), but it does matter when stamping values like 'datetime.now()' which will return local time.\n",
    "\n",
    "For best results, pre-convert your date values to UTC, and if using 'now' as a reference point use datetime.now(timezone.utc).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Timeliness Static\n",
